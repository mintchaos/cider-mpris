## RPC Documentation

### Hostname and Port

All API endpoints are accessible at `http://localhost:10767`.

We've observed that using `127.0.0.1` when IPv4 is disabled tends to break and not connect. We recommend you do not turn off IPv4, but if you are required to do so, try using `[::1]:10767`.

### Authentication

Unless explicitly disabled within Cider, all API requests require a valid API token. You can generate this token, or turn off authentication, from the menu at **Settings -\> Connectivity -\> Manage External Application Access to Cider** within Cider.

The generated token should be passed in the `apitoken` header of all requests. Do not prefix the token with `Bearer` or any other string; just pass the token by itself in the header.

This token is not required if disabled within the settings menu.

### /api/v1/playback

The API endpoints documented below are all nested under `/api/v1/playback`.

#### GET /active

Responds with an empty body and status code `204: No Content`. This endpoint can be used to quickly check that the RPC server is still active.

**204**: No Content `// No response body...`

#### GET /is-playing

Responds with a boolean value indicating whether music is currently playing.

**200**: OK
```
{
  "status": "ok",
  "is_playing": true
}
```

#### GET /now-playing

Responds with an Apple Music API response for the currently playing song.

**200**: OK
```

**200**: OK
```
{
  "status": "ok"
}

#### POST /playpause

Toggles the play/pause state of the current item. This has the same behavior as calling `/pause` if the item is playing, and `/play` if the item is paused.
